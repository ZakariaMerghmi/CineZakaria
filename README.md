## 📖 Project Overview

The **Advanced Quotes App** is a real-world, full-featured web application developed using **React** and **Firebase**. It allows users to sign in with Google, explore a curated list of motivational and inspirational quotes, and save their favorites in real-time using Firebase Firestore.

This project was built to deepen my experience with:
- 🔁 React state management using Context API
- 🔐 Authentication and authorization flow with Firebase
- 🌐 Integration with real-time databases (Firestore)
- 🧠 Component-based architecture and modular structure
- 🎨 Building responsive layouts with TailwindCSS
- 💻 Clean code practices and production-grade structure

## 🎯 Why I Built This Project

After mastering the fundamentals of React, I wanted to apply my knowledge in a project that includes **real-time features**, **user authentication**, and **external database integration**.

The goal of this project was not only to build a quote viewer, but to implement features often found in production-level applications like:
- Persistent user data
- Auth-protected pages
- Responsive UI
- Modular and scalable structure

By using Firebase, I also gained hands-on experience in building **serverless applications** and managing **NoSQL databases**.

## 🤝 What I Learned

Through this project, I improved my understanding of:
- Setting up Firebase projects and securing API keys
- Managing global state with React Context
- Handling user sessions, login/logout flow
- Reading/writing from Firestore in real time
- UI design with utility-first CSS (Tailwind)
- Structuring a scalable React codebase

This app represents a key step in my journey to becoming a **professional React developer**, and I'm excited to continue building more advanced full-stack applications.

## 🚀 What’s Next

In the future, I plan to:
- Add full text search functionality
- Let users submit their own quotes
- Build a dark mode toggle
- Improve animations and transitions using Framer Motion
