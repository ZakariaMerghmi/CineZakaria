# 🎬 CineZakaria – Advanced React Movie App with Firebase

**CineZakaria** is a full-featured movie browsing platform built with **React**, powered by **Firebase Authentication** and styled using **TailwindCSS**. The app fetches real-time movie data from **TMDB API**, allows users to log in, explore popular films, and save their favorites using `localStorage`.

Designed with clean architecture, routing, and state management — this project simulates a real production-level front-end experience.
